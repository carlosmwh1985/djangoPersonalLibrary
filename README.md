# Personal Library

A Django based website, designed to administrate a DB with all my books!


## Requirements

- `Python`
- `Psycopg`
- `PostgreSQL`
- `Django`
- A list with all your books! (LOL!)


## Description

The website connects to a DB, which contains a list of books (and authors and editorials), and display it in a table.

It is possible to see detailed views on each book and author. New entries can be added (WIP).
